# NobleFates-StacksandBuffs
This mod makes food/resources/seeds etc (minus gear) stack more, buffs some durability in rain, increases seed drop chance to 10%

//My second Mod, feel free to join my discord at discord.gg/antjpcNNb4 - I will add NF channels in the coming days like my other channels.
//I will make another version that only alters stacks, but I made this for myself. I feel like seeds should stack a lot and not decay as fast (like real life), also buffed durability in rain and seed drop chances.
